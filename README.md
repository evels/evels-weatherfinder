# evels-weatherfinder

This application charts the weather conditions at a location selected by a user via a map. The web UI allows the user to view weather condition data at a given location for a given date, defaulting to the current date/time. Weather data is accessed from https://developer.forecast.io/docs/v2.

There is a feature branch `temperature-chart` to chart temperature over the past 24 hours for the selected location. (incomplete)
